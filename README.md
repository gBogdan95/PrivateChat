## Private chat app using React and Firebase
I created a chat app using react and firebase hooks. For the design I used scss.

Users needs to authenticate with email and password and they are also required to choose a username and upload a profile picture upon registration. Once logged in, you can start a chat by typing a username, and if it matches a window of that user will pop up in which will display the last message he sent. Other features of the app are
uploading images in chat, displaying the date when each message was sent, and a logout button.
